Custom Web App for a Golf League. This site allows it's users to enter their score and set their availability for the following week. The Admin's are able to generate a schedule and post news for its members.

This Site was created for Women On Par, a Golf group from Toronto, Ontario.

## Lessons Learned

This is the largest project I have worked on. It combines many different aspects from database and authentication to user input and file generation.

Throughout this project I have learned to work with Strapi and their method of authentication and use of email and media integration. I have also expanded my knowledge with NextJS and TailwindCSS.
