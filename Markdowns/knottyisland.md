Website created for The Knotty Island, an online handmade Macrame Etsy store.

## Lessons Learned

he site was designed and created using NextJS utilizing the Etsy API. There is a small server created with NodeJS and Express to manage the API requests. The website was built and functions according the Client's Request and within the limitation of the API.

The API has a limit on requests that can be made per limit, but the limit seems arbitrary and can be frustrating because seperate requests need to be made to get the product details and pictures.
