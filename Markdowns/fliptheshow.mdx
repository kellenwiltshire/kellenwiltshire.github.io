Website created for flipping cards in the game MLB The Show 22

## Lessons Learned

The site was designed with NextJS and Emotion Styled Components. The site was a good lesson on how to format tables with lots of information to look good on multiple screen sizes.

## Features

Users are able to sort and filter the cards that are returned from the MLB The Show API to determine what the best cards are to buy and sell for maximum profit.

The site utilizes Static Props with short revalidate time to make sure that the information is always as up-to-date as possible and the site performs quickly.

Users are able to see how the cards are performing for Players, Equipment, and Stadiums. Each Card also has it's own page that uses Server Side Generation so Users can see more information on the card they may be buying.
